    "The global skin care market is projected to increase from USD 130 billion in 2020 to over USD177 billion by 2025 [[Statista, 2021]](https://www.statista.com/topics/4517/us-skin-care-market/#dossierKeyfigures). The ongoing growth of the industry shows the consumers' sustained interest in beauty regimes, as well as in basic personal care and hygiene practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the explosion of skincare brands around the world, consumers are faced with many choices, making it more difficult to make informed decisions of their purchases. Adding to information paralysis, there are costs increasing the barriers to the purchase. Time is spent on researching through a myriad of products and ingredients. Trial and error is also costly both in terms of time and money. Skincare products are not always cheap and it takes time to see results. There is also a risk that the product may cause adverse reactions which is a major concern especially for consumers with sensitive skin.\n",

    "By helping consumers understand what makes the product cheap or expensive and be aware of what they could be paying for, we can help them make more informed decisions. \n",
    "Consumers with a particular skin type, e.g. sensitive skin may also want to know if there are similar alternatives to their tried-and-tested products that can help them avoid unnecessary allergies.\n",
